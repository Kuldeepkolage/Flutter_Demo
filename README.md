📱 Flutter Learning Journey
🚀 Overview

This repository contains my Flutter learning journey and hands-on practice projects.
I am currently learning Flutter alongside my college academics and internship work. This repo is where I implement concepts, experiment with widgets, and build mini-projects as I progress.

📚 Learning Source
Udemy Flutter Masterclass (currently completed 14 out of 20 videos)
Self-practice and experimentation
Official Flutter documentation

I started pushing my work to GitHub after completing a major portion of the course, which is why earlier learning may not reflect in commit history. Going forward, I will be pushing updates consistently as I learn.

🛠 What This Repository Contains
Basic Flutter UI widgets
Stateless & Stateful widgets
Layouts (Row, Column, Container, etc.)
Navigation concepts
Forms & user input
Small experimental apps
Practice implementations
More advanced topics and projects will be added as I progress.

📈 Next Goals
Complete the course
Build structured mini-projects
Learn advanced state management
Integrate APIs
Work with Firebase
Follow clean architecture practices
